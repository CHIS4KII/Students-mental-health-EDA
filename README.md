# Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of mental health metrics within various academic demographics, helping to visualize and understand the impact of educational contexts on mental well-being. We analyze the data by grouping it based on:

* Degree Level (e.g., Undergraduate, Postgraduate)
* Degree Major (various academic disciplines)
* Each metric (depression, anxiety, isolation, and future insecurity) is summarized by statistical measures (sum, mean, min, max).

# Dataset
* Mental Health Metrics: Depression, anxiety, isolation, and future insecurity.
* Group Categories: degree_level and degree_major.
* The dataset is aggregated to show the average values of each metric for each group, highlighting trends and variations.

# Results
The project offers insights into how mental health metrics vary based on academic demographics. The heatmaps provide a visual representation of these differences, highlighting areas where specific groups may experience higher levels of depression, anxiety, etc.
